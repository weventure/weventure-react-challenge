# WEVENTURE React and Redux Coding Challenge

Thank you for applying for a position as a frontend developer.

To get a better feeling of your current skillset, we prepared a little coding challenge for you. Please download/clone this repository and create your own afterwards (please do not fork the repository to keep your results secret and the challenge fair to everyone).

The project is a little to-do App. We already provided a boilterplate React app with a finished CSS design for you.

The product specs are the following:

- a new to-do can be added by pressing the enter key
- an item can be marked as done by clicking on it
- an item can be deleted by clicking the "X" button
- the list can be cleared entirely with the button below

The technical specs are the following:

- please use **React and Redux** to complete the app
- please split the app into **components** where you think it makes sense to do so (e.g. list items)
- please handle the **global state** entirely in Redux

When you are done, commit your final codebase into a fresh repository and provide a README file explaining how the project can be run within a browser.

We look forward to check your results.

Warm regards,

the WEVENTURE Team
